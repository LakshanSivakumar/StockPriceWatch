# StockPriceWatch

This is just a simple python webscraper bot that i created which will check the price of a given stock on NASDAQ's website and update in the console every 10 seconds.(Will be adding a feature to state how long notification interval should be for.)

## Features of this Webscraper Bot
- Notified of new price and if it increased/decreased/unchanged
- Sends an email notification to your email when the price of the stock is above your watch price.
- (Will be adding soon) 
  Interval of notifications
  
  
  ### Disclaimer any losses made due to this bot somehow is not my responsibility lol; take care.
